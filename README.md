# Inconsistent State Updates in React Component

This example demonstrates a common issue in React applications where the state is inconsistently updated, leading to unexpected behavior and potentially hard-to-debug issues.  The `MyComponent` modifies its state (`count`) in two different places: directly within the `handleClick` function and indirectly through the `anotherFunctionThatModifiesCount` function. This approach can easily lead to race conditions and make it hard to track the state's evolution.

## Bug
The bug lies in the inconsistent updates to the `count` state.  The `anotherFunctionThatModifiesCount` function also modifies the state, leading to unpredictable increments. This violates the principle of single source of truth for state management in React.

## Solution
The solution focuses on centralizing state updates.  All state modifications should ideally happen in one place, within the `handleClick` function or a similar central handler.
